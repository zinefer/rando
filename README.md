# Rando

Rando is a fun and interactive web application that randomizes lists with engaging animations. It's designed to be visually appealing while providing practical functionality for randomizing items.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **List Randomization**: Shuffle your list items with a click of a button
- **URL Hash-Based Lists**: Items and sticky status are stored in the URL hash (`#`) for easy sharing and bookmarking using a custom format.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Press Ctrl+C to copy the randomized list to clipboard
- **Auto-Copy**: Optionally enable automatic copying to clipboard after randomization

### User Interface
- **Card Grid Layout**: Items displayed as a grid of attractive cards
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Feedback**: Notifications when items are copied to clipboard

### Customization
- **Sticky Items**: Mark specific items as "sticky" to keep them in place during randomization
- **Custom Templates**: Format how items appear when copied to clipboard
- **Animation Selection**: Choose which animations to include in the random pool
- **Tab Switch Animation**: Optional animation when returning to the tab

### Animations
Rando includes 11 different animations for shuffling:
- Fly and Spin
- Elastic Bounce
- Swirl Vortex
- Matrix Rain
- Chain Juggle
- Swing Chain
- Tornado
- Fireworks

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Visit the application URL
2. Enter your list items in the settings panel
3. Click the "Randomize" button to shuffle the items
4. Press Ctrl+C to copy the randomized list to clipboard

### URL Hash Format
The application uses the URL hash fragment (`#`) to store the list state, allowing you to share your configuration by simply sharing the URL. The format is custom-designed for readability:

`#Item1,Item2->ExportVal2,ðŸ“ŒItem3`

- **`,` (Comma):** Separates individual list items.
- **`->` (Arrow):** Separates the display `name` from the `export` value for items that have distinct values (e.g., `Item2->ExportVal2`).
- **Encoding:** To ensure correctness, special characters (`,`, `->`, `ðŸ“Œ`, and others) within item names or export values are automatically URL-encoded (e.g., `%2C` for a comma). This might make some parts less readable but guarantees the format works reliably.

### Settings Panel
Access the settings panel by clicking the gear icon to:
- Edit your list items
- Set custom templates for clipboard export
- Toggle which items should be "sticky"
- Configure animation preferences
- Enable/disable auto-copy and tab switch animations

### Templates
Use templates to format how items appear when copied to clipboard:
- `{item}` - The basic item text
- `{pad:N}` - Add padding spaces to make items a specific length

Example: `{pad:10}{item}` will ensure each item has at least 10 characters by adding spaces.
