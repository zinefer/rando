## Rando

Rando is a static web-app (github pages) that randomizes the order of a list of items in a fun and whimsical way.

- Easy on the eyes
- List of items are taken in from the URL
- The list is displayed as a grid of square cards
  - With a nice border
  - Complementary colors
  - Card-like hover effect
  - Cards are draggable to reorder
- The cards are animated to shuffle around the screen
- There is a button to randomize the order of the items
- Ctrl+C to copy the randomized list to the clipboard
- A settings panel
  - Set a template for the list items when copied
  - Ability to make one or more items "sticky" (i.e. not shuffle)
  - Adjusting the list should be done here and adjusts the URL
